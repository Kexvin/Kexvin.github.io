                Our app showcases the menu review of items served at every food court, and students give unbiased feedback towards their opinion on the food. As well as, a dining tracking feature that shows how long the wait time is at every dining hall. Then finally, it shows the food calorie information and macros.

 <p>
 Our app allows the user to sign in using their student account and allows them select one of three options from the home menu. That is the Calorie Tracker, Dining Traffic tracker, and the menu review section. The Calorie tracker allows the user to search up the food served at USC through a database to display their caloric content and macros. The Dining Hall Traffic feature allows the user to see the wait times at each of the dining halls and the number of people currently inside. The Menu Review portion allows the user to see the star ratings of the daily menu at each dining hall displayed on the present day, and students can review the food and it shows when the reviews were made.
